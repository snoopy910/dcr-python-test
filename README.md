# Digital Control Room - Python Test

Thank you for thaking the time to complete this exercise.

## Introduction

Please clone (don't fork) this repository, complete the exercises below and then upload to a public repository on github and send us the link.

Please don't spend more than 2 hours on this task (not including initial download and setup). If you reach 2 hours, please commit your code as-is to your repository.

## Project Setup

You will need python3.8+ to run this code.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<TBC>

cd dcr-python-test
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin <Your Repository>

cd src
python3 list_countries.py
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1 - Add Stats

Please add a script that will provide aggregated stats for each region. The stats should contain:
 * The region's name
 * The number of countries in that region (a simple count)
 * The total population of the region (the sum of the population of each country)

The output should be JSON with a format:
```json
{
    "regions": [
        {
        "name": "Africa",
        "number_countries": xxx,
        "total_population": xxx
        },
        {
        "name": "Americas",
        "number_countries": xxx,
        "total_population": xxx
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

### Exercise 2 - Integrate with API

The script:
```bash
python load_data.py
```
currently populates the database from a local JSON file. Please update this management command to obtain the JSON input data from this url: `https://storage.googleapis.com/dcr-django-test/countries.json`

### Exercise 3 - Store additional Data

The previous script:
```bash
python load_data.py
```
currently extracts and stores the data:
 * name
 * alpha2Code
 * alpha3Code
 * population
 * region

Please update the database tables and management command to also import:
 * topLevelDomain
 * capital

 Please record any SQL commands executed to modify the database schema.
